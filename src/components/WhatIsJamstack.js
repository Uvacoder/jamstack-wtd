            Dynamic functionalities are handled by JavaScript. There is no

          <SubSectionText>
            Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and
            accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third party
            services or your custom function.

          <SubSectionText>
            Websites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated
            from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator.

          Today, Jamstack is used to more broadly refer to an architectural
          approach for building websites. Though there are varying opinions on
          what exactly Jamstack means today, these attributes are present in
          most sites that claim to be Jamstack sites:

          <SubSectionText>
            The front end uses tooling separate from the back end. The front end
            is typically built using a static site generator. And the back end
            is often integrated with the front through the use of APIs used
            during the build process. Server-side processes can also be run
            using serverless functions.

          <SubSectionText>
            While various practices exist for introducing dynamic elements to
            Jamstack sites, most are pre-rendered, which means the front end was
            built and compiled into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

            JavaScript can be introduced to pre-rendered sites on an as-needed
            basis, thus increasing performance in the browser.

          <SubSectionText>
            Front end developers can focus on the front end, without being tied
            to a monolithic architecture. This usually means quicker and more
            focused development.

          <SubSectionText>
            If your product suddenly goes viral and has many active users, the
            CDN seamlessly compensates.

            via CDN. This provides better performance and easier scalability.

          <SubSectionText>
            Once your build is uploaded, the CDN invalidates its cache. This
            means that your new build is live in an instant.

            Your server is notified when a new build is required, typically via

            is live.
